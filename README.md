I'm Creating an application that automates my tasks and at the same time I'm learning python. 

What this app does is istead of having 10 tabs open and switching between them constantly, I just run this app and I get multiple item prices in the same page.

TODO:
1- add a button next to the Name of the item to send me to the items page.
2- ✅make a fully transparent user input for the name of the items✅ and make the app be able to save the last entered item for each item slot
3- add a button next to the lowest price that places a sell order with the price being (lowest price - 1) or maybe add a button for all of them because of some scenarios
4- fix prices making contact with platinum icon ✅
5- fix item names not being centered ✅
6- make the titel bar az thin as discord(also add icon and a titel for god sake)
7- maybe HARD ONE: make the app launch immediately and then load the prices
8- add slight blur to the gray backgrounds, or maybe completely replace them with slight blur
9- maybe add a button next to the item name that opens the candle chart of price history

What I learned:
ALWAYS set the correct names in Qt Designer before copieng everything so you dont have to rename 198 labels and buttons ect...
