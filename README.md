I'm Creating an application that automates my tasks and using it as a challenge to learn python, and taking every opportunity to learn more. 

What this app does is istead of having 10 tabs open and switching between them constantly, I just run this app and I get multiple item prices in the same page.

TODO:
1- add a button next to the Name of the item to send me to the items page. ✅

2- make a fully transparent user input for the name of the items and make the app be able to save the last entered item for each item slot ✅

3- add a button next to the lowest price that places a sell order with the price being (lowest price - 1) or maybe add a button for all of them because of some scenarios

4- fix prices making contact with platinum icon ✅

5- fix item names not being centered ✅

6- make the titel bar az thin as discord(also add icon and a titel for god sake)(almost done)

7- maybe HARD ONE: make the app launch immediately and then load the prices ✅

8- add slight blur to the gray backgrounds, or maybe completely replace them with slight blur

9- maybe add a button next to the item name that opens the candle chart of price history

10- Add auto refresh for all of the  items, also add a way to customize how long every refresh takes with the minimum of once per 5 seconds(so that the app does not crash)(Added a refresh button instead)

11- don't let the search button work until the last search has finished. ✅


What I learned:

ALWAYS set the correct names in Qt Designer before copying everything so you dont have to rename 198 labels and buttons ect...

use OOP

the exec() function is insane
